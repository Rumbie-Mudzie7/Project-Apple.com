Additional description about the project and its features.
In this project, I made use of DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principles to make a clone of the Apple.com's page. Since the project's objective is focused on background images and gradients, I implemented the practice as required with particular emphasis on using a background color as well as a hovering linear gradient color.
